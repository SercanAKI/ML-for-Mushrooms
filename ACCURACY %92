# Mushroom classification 🍄

In this project, we will use a public dataset from kaggle.com, the “Mushroom Classification” dataset, and try to figure out if a mushroom is edible or not. This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms. Each species is identified as edible or poisonous. When it comes to mushrooms, there is no simple rule for determining the edibility.

We will tackle this classification problem using logistic regression, ridge classifier, decision tree, Naive Bayes, and neural networks. After comparing the results of each model, we will find out the best performing one.

## Importing the required libraries

As always we’ll start with importing the required libraries.

📌 Use the keywords "import" and "from".
"""

# Import Pandas and Matplotlib
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Import Label Encoder and train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Import Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, Decision Tree
# Gaussian Naive Bayes, MLP Classifier and Random Forest models
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, RidgeClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
# Import Classification Report function
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

"""## Dataset and preprocessing
The dataset includes data from 8124 mushrooms. Each of  these mushroom samples have 22 features and they are categorized as edible or poisonous.

### Read the data

Let’s read the .csv file.

📌 Use the read_csv() function of the Pandas library.
"""

# Read the "mushroom.csv" file
data = pd.read_csv("/content/sample_data/mushrooms.csv")

"""###Visualize the data
Then, take a look at the dataset using *data.head()* function.
"""

# Use the head() function to display the first 5 rows of the data
data.head()

"""Now, to have a better understanding of the dataset, we can utilize some visualization techniques. For example, by creating a bar graph, we can compare the different classes.

We’ll start with finding the number of samples per class.

📌 Use the value_counts() method.
"""

# Use value_counts method on "class" column of data object
classes = data['class'].value_counts()

# Print the result
classes

"""With this information, we can create bars for each class and display the graph.

📌 Use the .bar() method to create the graph.

📌 Don't forget to use plt.show().
"""

# Add the bar for edible class
plt.bar("Edible", classes["e"])

# Add the bar for poisonous class
plt.bar("Poisonous", classes["p"])

# Print the plot
plt.show()

"""### Features and labels
Great, we have a better understanding of our data. Now we’ll divide it into features and corresponding labels. 

In our case we’ll use the columns “cap-shape”, “cap-color”, “ring-number” and “ring-type” as features.

📌 Use the .loc() method to create X and y datasets.
"""

# Create the X variable for features
X = data.loc[: , ["cap-shape", "cap-color", "ring-number", "ring-type"]]

# Create the y variable for output labels
y = data.loc[:, "class"]

"""###Converting the values 

The values are in string format. We need to convert them to integer values to be able to perform mathematical operations with them. We’ll use label encoding for this.

📌 Since the X-data has multiple columns, do this in a for loop so that you can update all columns at once.

📌 For the y data, use the encoder directly.
"""

"""Let’s print both X and y to see the final data."""

#Print y

"""### Split the data
Finally, we can split our data into training and test datasets.

📌 Use the train_test_split function from sklearn.
"""

# Split the dataset into train and test sets with 70-30 ratio
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)
